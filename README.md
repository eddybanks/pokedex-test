# The Mini Pokedex

This project is a small test pokedex project for one of my job applications.
It is built using create-react-app with the typescript template.

Some of the npm packages I installed to help include:

- SWR: a react hook library for data fetching
- Axios: an http client for aiding with accessing the REST api
- Styled Components: for css styling

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply clone this repo, cd into the root folder of application (if you aren't there) and run the following commands:

`yarn install`

Only run yarn install once after cloning the repo to install the necessary npm packages.

`yarn start`

This should be run everytime you want to view the application in your browser.

`yarn test`

Only necessary to run tests (which this app may or may not have at this time)
